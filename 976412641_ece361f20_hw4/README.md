# ECE 361 Homework #4 -- Hashing and hash tables, qsort() and bsearch()
## <i>This assignment will be worth 100 points and is due by 10:00 PM on Wed 25-Nov-2020.  Sorry, no extra credit opportunities for this assignment</i>  

### After completing this assignment students should have:
- Developed an application that makes use of hashing and a hash table ADT
- Gained experience with the standard C library functions for sorting and searching


### Introduction

This assignment consists of two programming assignments.  The first program builds on the MLS application you wrote for HW #3 to use a hash table for looking up team information.  I have provided a functional hash able ADT.  You will use the hash table ADT, MLS_Helpers.c or your equivalent, and a new main() that queries a user to enter information that can be used to look up the team info for the selected team.  

The second programming project makes use of the C standard library function for searching and sorting to provide information on the now-obsolete CGA graphics standard.

We are using GitHub Classroom for this assignment so make your final commit to your GitHub private repository for the assignment before the deadline.  Also, please upload a .zip file of your final repository to your Homework #4 dropbox in D2L.  C Source code for your programming solutions should be text files (not .docx, etc.) that have a .c extension.  Header files should be text files that have a .h extension.  Your transcripts (logs) should be submitted as text files (.log) by either redirecting the output from your shell to a file or by using the BASH tee command to send output to both the console and a file (ex: $ echo “hello world” |tee helloworld.log). Name all of the files in the repository with descriptive names.  be sure your code is organized indented appropriately, uses meaningful variable names, and includes comments that aid in understanding your code.  Readability counts for this assignment.


NOTES:
- If you decide to leverage (borrow) existing code for your solutions other than code I provided please acknowledge the source. Copying existing code from the web without acknowledging the source will lead to serious consequences if you are caught cheating.

- You may collaborate with one of your classmates in the design of the applications, but you are both expected to submit original work.  There is a difference between collaboration and copying - you don't want to be caught doing the latter since that could affect both your final grade and the grade of the student you copied from.  Please acknowledge the person you collaborated with in at least one of your source code files.

- Please post questions on the assignment to the Homework #4 discussion forum on D2L.  Doing so helps your fellow students understand the assignment, makes it easier for Rishitosh and I to keep up with questions, and avoids the risk that your question will slip out of our view.  You may post anonymously in the forum.  Thanks to all of you who posted questions and solutions on the discussion forum.
